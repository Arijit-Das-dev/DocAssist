# DocAssist

# 🍳 Overview
DocAssist is a document-based question answering system built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
It enables users to upload documents (PDFs) and interact with them using natural language queries.
Instead of relying on generic LLM knowledge, DocAssist retrieves relevant document chunks and generates responses strictly grounded in the uploaded content, reducing hallucinations and improving answer accuracy.
